
SSPIF set
 in case of overflow 
 BF set before a receive.
 falling edge of 9th scl pulse in an address receive (BF set on 8th edge)
 receive a data byte.
 at the end of each write.	

Clear BF by reading SSBUF
Clear overvlow SSPCON,SSPOV in software.

Must write to SSPBUF before releasing CKP

Bits sampled on rising edge of SCL


SDA can only change when SCL is low (apart from start when SDA goes low and stop SDA goes high).

~ACK is active low as requires slave to be present to generate properly.  If no acive slave then would float high.

None of the diagrams show SSPIF being set on start or stop.

Note - Current 8031 implementation is probably out of timing (see delays in I2C master)
